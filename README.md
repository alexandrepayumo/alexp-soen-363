The first part of this assignment to populate nodes and relationships can be seen in PopulateNeo4j.py

The second part of this assignment involving cypher queries is seen in Queries.cypher.

HelperQueries.cypher includes queries I used that were not part of the assignment's query requirements.

add_overview_to_films.py and add_planets_to_films.py were python scripts I used to modify the CSV data.
